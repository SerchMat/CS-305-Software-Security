# CS-305-Software-Security

* Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  * Global Rain, a software engineering company, specializes in custom software design and development. Global Rain has a mission which is “Security is everyone’s responsibility”, securing companies against malicious user has been an important subject in recent years between companies since as technology scale, malicious users grow with it. Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops financial plans, has recently a partnership with Global Rain to modernize their software and implement the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a high amount of individual personal information, that why Global Rain needs to make sure to secure and protect the integrity of Artemis Financial.

* What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  * Overall, the best part I did was creating an SHA-256 algorithm cipher, I thing the development of the algorithm cipher was developed properly and the functionality was excellent. It's always important to secure the code to prevent any malicious user to have access to sensitive information or access to our system. Adding security to the company will provide security for their customer and the company so that their information is not easy to access. The companies are more trustable.  

* What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  * The most challenging part was to develop a secure connection to the website using Algorithm Cipher since the code was able to hash the message but was unable to produce a secure connection. It's challeging if you do not implement the key and the certification. 

* How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  * I will increase the security by adding a algorith cypher, HTTPS, use certification to confirm the site, constant check and upgrade if is needed. These examples will provide more security to the code/software/application.

* How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  * To verify that the software application was functional and secure I follow the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow, which indicates what vulnenarabilities occur within the code. To verify that there are no more vulnerabilities I run the dependency check to verify that there are no more vulnerabilities or increases to the existing ones.

* What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  * Increase problem-solving skills and always look into small things, sometimes small things like missing and semicoma or miss spell a word, this type of issue tends to occur frequently. Details are important for the success of every software/application, if we do not pay attention to details malicious users can find a vulnerability and exploit it.

* Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  * To my future employer, I will show them my progress during this and all my courses to show the capability and effort that I been accumulated during my school year. Also, the skills that I develop will be able to satisfy the need of the team. Companies are looking for someone with the right skill, midset, knowledge, and effort to succeed in the company and I will be able to show all those requirements by demonstrating based on my experience and school work.
